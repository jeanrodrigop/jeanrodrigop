# Hello World!

Technology lover aiming at the fullstack web and mobile.

Curious and passionate about knowledge, I always look for a way to help people applying technology. Migrating from the infra area, I am in the infancy of development, I can't wait to take the first steps alone!

- I’m currently working on **HTML, CSS & Docker**;
- Learning **JS, PHP & MySQL**;
- Looking others for my stack!
- I’m looking to collaborate!
- Some help!
